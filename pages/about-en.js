            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Batuhan. I live in in Istanbul. I am a senior
                    at the Gebze Technical University, and soon to be electronic engineer.
                    As a summary of my university life, I have encountered software in 
                    the first year and continued to progress every day by putting on the 
                    fundamental knowledge that I learned in school. 
                    <p>
                    During this time, I worked on the python language and improved 
                    myself in various areas such as image processing, machine learning 
                    and signal processing with Python. In addition I made a robot arm 
                    and various projects with Arduino.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    C/C++, Matlab and Python are programming languages that I am good at.
                    Also I am familiar with HTML, CSS and a bit of Flutter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I love the internet, technology, and building beautiful things.
                    Some of my favorite things to do are read, 
                    coding and learning new things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My career aspirations are to have a professional career in software 
                    development as well as to improve myself in machine learning and
                    deep learning. 
                    </p>
                </p>
